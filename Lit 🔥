Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight

Born sinner, the opposite, of a winner
Remember when I used to eat, sardines for dinner

I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped

Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match

It was all a dream, I used to read Word-Up magazine

The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me

I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
 
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast

Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this

50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur

Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that

Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back

And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source

We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us

Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To all the ladies in the place, with style and grace
Allow me to lace, these lyrical douches in your bushes

But I just can't quit
Because one of these honies Biggie gots ta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
