Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight

Born sinner, the opposite, of a winner
Remember when I used to eat, sardines for dinner

I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped

Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match

It was all a dream, I used to read Word-Up magazine

The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy
Girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me

I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff
 
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast

Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this

50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur

Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that

Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back

And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source

We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us

Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To all the ladies in the place, with style and grace
Allow me to lace, these lyrical douches in your bushes

But I just can't quit
Because one of these honies Biggie gots ta creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?

So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape

Conversate for a few, 'cause in a few, we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right boo (true)

Forget the telly we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi smoke L's while you do me

In mansion and Benz's givin' ends to my friends and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream, f*.k a dollar and a dream

Throw your hands in the air, if you's a true player
To the honies gettin' money playin' fellows like dummies
Ya got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place

We in that Sunshine State where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty

And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmie in the city of sex

I been in the game for 10 years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon

Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace

It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Lights is blinding, girls need blinders
Or they could step out of bounds quick, the sidelines is

Lined with casualties, who sip to life casually
Then gradually become worse, don't bite the apple, Eve

Caught up in the in crowd, now you're in-style
And in the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
